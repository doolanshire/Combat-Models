# A Python implementation of the Royal Navy's 1921 wargame rules. It is designed to create a model of a battle from a
# series of external, human-readable files, and then resolve it by playing out the action at one-minute intervals. The
# battle outcome can be logged or plotted for analysis.

# PARSER FUNCTIONS #
####################

# These functions open and parse the external files needed for the model to run. The files contain model settings,
# battle data, fleet lists, gun specifications etc. Please note that the Royal Navy's 1921 model is relatively simple
# and it only uses a small fraction of the information in the input files. Other wargame rule sets, such as the Naval
# War College's 1922 Maneuver Rules, may use all parameters.

    equivalent hitting power for the two: capital ship guns are all converted to 15-inch hits, and light division guns
    are all converted to 6-inch hits. These two equations are not compatible, so the model cannot really compare the
    relative firepower of groups of different types.

    - Groups outnumbering their target group fire with a penalty to their accuracy as defined in the 1921 rules.
    - When firing, each individual ship in the group fires in turn, targeting only the enemy ships it can damage.
    - Damage is distributed among all target ships proportionally to their remaining staying power. In other words,
    all target ships are aggregated into one for damage purposes.

    Note that the same ship can be registered in more than one group. A ship may receive fire as part of a large
